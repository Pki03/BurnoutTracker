## ðŸ§  What is BurnoutTracker?

BurnoutTracker helps organizations keep track of employee well-being by allowing users to log their daily mood. When a user is predicted to be "Unfit" to work multiple times consecutively, the app notifies HR, offering tools to take action â€” such as contacting employees or assigning a counselor.

This app aims to promote **mental health awareness**, **prevent workplace burnout**, and **streamline HR intervention** using tech.
